
Project Description
Live Web Based Demo:
https://butterflycatcher.herokuapp.com/

Butterflycatcher is a web based video media collector application. 
Users can log on and create collections, search for and collect YouTube videos and add them to single and multiple collections. 
Users can share their collections publically to all users and privately to single users.
Users can send their collections to single users and multiple users. 
Users are notified when someone plays one of their collections or one of their tracks from their collections. 
Users can also redistribute collections sent to them. 
When a user redistributes a collection they will also be notified along with original creators when the collection 
has been played or a track from the collection has been played by other users.  
Currently the application only allows for collection of YouTube videos. 
In the future will be working to allow users to collect from other video and media sources. 
In the future the application will allow users to add music, web sites, pictures, various media 
and other types of video outside of YouTube to their collections.
